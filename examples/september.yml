  message: This quest expires in 14 days! Use /quest expiry to see how long you have
    left. Dont forget the objective changes every 10 minutes!
  help:
  - This quest expires after 14 days.
  - This month the quest objective changes every 10 minutes. Your progress will carry
    over. These means you need to complete 10,000 interactions total, not 10,000 of
    each.
  - The objective wont change unless it is in your offhand.
  - When you hear a bell sound that means the scroll has changed.
