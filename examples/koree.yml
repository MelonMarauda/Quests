    - So, the staff is away working hard on moderating the server…But the issue is I need some help setting up for the party celebrating Applecraft’s 6th birthday! You look like you could be helpful. 
    - First thing we need is a birthday cake. What’s a party without the cake!? I think someone in Helper Village could point you in the right direction.
